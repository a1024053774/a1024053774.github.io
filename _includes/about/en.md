## Self-Introduction

I'm Yuanshan Jiang Jinyue (LuckyE), currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering. I'm passionate about computer science and software development, with systematic learning and research experience in the Java programming language.

### Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages** : Proficient in Java fundamentals and object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques, ranging from basic syntax to advanced features (polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstract classes, etc.)

**Database Technologies** : Familiar with SQL language and database system theories, including relational model design, query optimization, and database security

**Software Development** : Hands-on project experience in warehouse management system development, particularly in approval process implementation and database optimization modules

### Learning Characteristics

My learning style is systematic and practice-oriented. I enjoy organizing knowledge into structured frameworks and applying theoretical concepts through practical projects. My study notes reflect both attention to technical details and deep pursuit of fundamental principles.

### Personal Interests

Beyond programming, I'm an avid Taylor Swift fan, with *Enchanted* being my favorite song. My favorite album is *1989*. I also maintain technical blogs to share knowledge and document learning experiences.

### Personal Style

I emphasize systematic knowledge acquisition and organization, with strong information categorization skills and a passion for knowledge sharing.
